Let the snake eat your playlist >:)

[Demo video](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/cd3a697835a465c76175399738ba80a46f32efec_2025-09-23_23-49-51.mp4)

## I. So what is this ._.?

+ This is a simple snake game but instead of eating apple, the snake eat your playlist or your favorite album >:)

+ This game takes inspiration from the Spotify Snake game, but the original game is limited in IOS device in certain country, thats why I make this game.

## II. How to play:

+ You have to login with Spotify in order to fetch and play the song you ate :D.

+ You can use W/A/S/D or Arrow key or Arrow button (if you are on mobile device) to navigate the snake and eat the playlist.

## III. Limitation:

+ You can only play this game with sound if you have a Spotify Premium account. Yeah, that's sad ðŸ˜­

+ The game is limited in a 35 x 35 board, which means the highest score you can achive is limited to 1225 points.

+ There is some strange line cut through the snake. I have no idea what is that or how to fix that (sorry ;-;)

## IV. How to install this on your machine:

+ Download [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)

+ Download this [repo](https://github.com/VaitoSoi/simple-spotify-snake)

+ Run command `bun run start`.

+ Create a Spotify app following [this instruction](./docs/CREATE_APP.md)

+ Enjoy the game at [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) (It have to be `127.0.0.1:8080` or you will recieve `Mismatch state` error)
