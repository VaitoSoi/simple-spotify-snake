Let the snake eat your playlist >:)

[Demo video](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/cd3a697835a465c76175399738ba80a46f32efec_2025-09-23_23-49-51.mp4)

## I. So what is this ._.?

+ This is a simple snake game but instead of eating apple, the snake eat your playlist or your favorite album >:)

+ This game takes inspiration from the Spotify Snake game, but the original game is limited in IOS device in certain country, thats why I make this game.

## II. How to play:

+ You have to login with Spotify in order to fetch and play the song you ate :D.

+ You can use W/A/S/D or Arrow key or Arrow button (if you are on mobile device) to navigate the snake and eat the playlist.

## III. Limitation:

+ You can only play this game with sound if you have a Spotify Premium account. Yeah, that's sad ðŸ˜­

+ The game is limited in a 35 x 35 board, which means the highest score you can achive is limited to 1225 points.

+ There is some strange line cut through the snake. I have no idea what is that or how to fix that (sorry ;-;)
